      question: "How long does it take to generate a portrait?",
      answer: "Our AI generates your pet's portrait in under 30 seconds! You'll see the result almost instantly after uploading and selecting a style."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of photos work best?",
      answer: "For the best results, upload a clear, well-lit photo of your pet where their face is clearly visible. Front-facing photos usually work best, but we can work with side profiles too."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use a custom style or scene?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer a 'Custom Scene' option where you can describe exactly what you want, like 'my dog on a skateboard' or 'my cat in a chef's hat'. Be as detailed as possible for the best results."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't like the generated portrait?",
      answer: "We offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee. If you're not happy with your portrait, contact us within 24 hours for a full refund or a free re-generation."
    },
    {
      question: "Is my photo private and secure?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Your uploaded photos are processed securely and automatically deleted from our servers within 24 hours. We never store or share your personal images."
    },
    {
      question: "What file formats are supported?",
      answer: "We support JPG and PNG image formats, up to 10MB in size. Most smartphone photos work perfectly."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use the portraits commercially?",
      answer: "Our Unlimited plan includes a commercial use license. Basic and Pro plans are for personal use only. Check our pricing page for more details."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with all types of pets?",
      answer: "Yes! Our AI works great with dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, hamsters, and most other pets. The clearer the photo, the better the result."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get multiple styles of the same pet?",
      answer: "Absolutely! You can generate as many different styles as you want. Each generation counts toward your plan limit."
    },
    {
      question: "What resolution are the final images?",
      answer: "All portraits are generated in high resolution (1024x1024 pixels) and delivered as PNG files for the best quality."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I print the portraits?",
      answer: "Yes! The high-resolution files are perfect for printing. They look great as 8x10 prints or larger."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I contact support?",
      answer: "You can reach our support team through the Contact page or email us directly at support@furtoon.com. We typically respond within 24 hours."
