About
FLUX.1 Kontext [pro] -- Frontier image editing model.

Kontext makes editing images easy! Specify what you want to change and Kontext will follow. It is capable of understanding the context of the image, making it easier to edit them without having to describe in details what you want to do.

1. Calling the API
#
Install the client
#
The client provides a convenient way to interact with the model API.


pip install fal-client
Setup your API Key
#
Set FAL_KEY as an environment variable in your runtime.


export FAL_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
Submit a request
#
The client API handles the API submit protocol. It will handle the request status updates and return the result when the request is completed.

PythonPython (async)

import fal_client

def on_queue_update(update):
    if isinstance(update, fal_client.InProgress):
        for log in update.logs:
           print(log["message"])

result = fal_client.subscribe(
    "fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "Put a donut next to the flour.",
        "image_url": "https://v3.fal.media/files/rabbit/rmgBxhwGYb2d3pl3x9sKf_output.png"
    },
    with_logs=True,
    on_queue_update=on_queue_update,
)
print(result)
2. Authentication
#
The API uses an API Key for authentication. It is recommended you set the FAL_KEY environment variable in your runtime when possible.

API Key
#
Protect your API Key
When running code on the client-side (e.g. in a browser, mobile app or GUI applications), make sure to not expose your FAL_KEY. Instead, use a server-side proxy to make requests to the API. For more information, check out our server-side integration guide.

3. Queue
#
Long-running requests
For long-running requests, such as training jobs or models with slower inference times, it is recommended to check the Queue status and rely on Webhooks instead of blocking while waiting for the result.

Submit a request
#
The client API provides a convenient way to submit requests to the model.

PythonPython (async)

import fal_client

handler = fal_client.submit(
    "fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext",
    arguments={
        "prompt": "Put a donut next to the flour.",
        "image_url": "https://v3.fal.media/files/rabbit/rmgBxhwGYb2d3pl3x9sKf_output.png"
    },
    webhook_url="https://optional.webhook.url/for/results",
)

request_id = handler.request_id
Fetch request status
#
You can fetch the status of a request to check if it is completed or still in progress.

PythonPython (async)

status = fal_client.status("fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext", request_id, with_logs=True)
Get the result
#
Once the request is completed, you can fetch the result. See the Output Schema for the expected result format.

PythonPython (async)

result = fal_client.result("fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext", request_id)
4. Files
#
Some attributes in the API accept file URLs as input. Whenever that's the case you can pass your own URL or a Base64 data URI.

Data URI (base64)
#
You can pass a Base64 data URI as a file input. The API will handle the file decoding for you. Keep in mind that for large files, this alternative although convenient can impact the request performance.

Hosted files (URL)
#
You can also pass your own URLs as long as they are publicly accessible. Be aware that some hosts might block cross-site requests, rate-limit, or consider the request as a bot.

Uploading files
#
We provide a convenient file storage that allows you to upload files and use them in your requests. You can upload files using the client API and use the returned URL in your requests.

PythonPython (async)

url = fal_client.upload_file("path/to/file")
Read more about file handling in our file upload guide.

5. Schema
#
Input
#
prompt string
The prompt to generate an image from.

seed integer
The same seed and the same prompt given to the same version of the model will output the same image every time.

guidance_scale float
The CFG (Classifier Free Guidance) scale is a measure of how close you want the model to stick to your prompt when looking for a related image to show you. Default value: 3.5

sync_mode boolean
If set to true, the function will wait for the image to be generated and uploaded before returning the response. This will increase the latency of the function but it allows you to get the image directly in the response without going through the CDN.

num_images integer
The number of images to generate. Default value: 1

output_format OutputFormatEnum
The format of the generated image. Default value: "jpeg"

Possible enum values: jpeg, png

Possible enum values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Note: This property is only available through API calls.

aspect_ratio AspectRatioEnum
The aspect ratio of the generated image.

Possible enum values: 21:9, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 1:1, 2:3, 3:4, 9:16, 9:21
